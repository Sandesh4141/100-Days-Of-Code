# Accessing Vectors - 
# By using indexing we can access elements of vectors

X <- c(1,5,54,349, 44)

# Vector Operations
# Combining Vectors
# Arithmatic Operations
	# 1. Add
	# 2. subtract
	# 3. multiply	
	# 4. divide
# Sorting Vectors

#Combining Vectors
# c() function also used for combing vectors
# e.g
num = c(1,2,3,4)
str = c('one', 'two', 'three', 'four')
combined = c(num, str)
print(combined)


# Arithmatic operations
a <- c(1,2,3,4,5)
b <- c(6,7,8,9,10)
print(a + b)
print(a -b)
print(a / b)
print(a * b)
